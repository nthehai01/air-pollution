# Air Pollution Project

This is the Programming assignment 1 of [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/) on Coursera.

## Introduction

For this first programming assignment you will write three functions that are mean to interact with dataset that accompanies this assignment. The dataset is contained in a zip file specdata.zip that you can download from the Coursera web site. 

## Project Summary

This project is falling into 3 parts:

> *Part 1*: Calculating the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors.

> *Part 2*: Reporting the number of completely observed cases in each monitors.

> *Part 3*: Calculating the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than a given *threshold*.

Concretely, check the published version of the code notebook [here](https://rpubs.com/nthehai01/air-pollution) for more information.
